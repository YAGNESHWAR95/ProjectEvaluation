## Overview

This server powers a multi-role academic project evaluation system. It supports three user roles -- Student, Faculty, and Admin -- each with distinct permissions and workflows. Students submit projects with file uploads, Faculty evaluate submissions through a multi-phase grading pipeline, and Admins manage users, deadlines, and platform-wide analytics.

## Services

| Service                | File                       | Description                                                |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Storage Service        | `storageService.js`        | Handles file uploads via Cloudinary signed URLs or local disk fallback |
| Report Service         | `reportService.js`         | Generates CSV reports with evaluation metrics              |
| Notification Service   | `notificationService.js`   | Dispatches notifications to users                          |

## Error Handling

The server uses a custom `AppError` class that extends the native `Error` with an HTTP status code and operational flag. All errors are caught by the global `errorHandler` middleware, which returns consistent JSON responses:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Description of what went wrong"
}
```

Unhandled promise rejections and uncaught exceptions are caught at the process level, logged, and trigger a graceful shutdown.

## File Uploads

The server supports two storage backends:

1. **Cloudinary (primary)** -- When Cloudinary environment variables are configured, the server generates signed upload URLs for direct browser-to-cloud uploads. Integrity checksums are verified on the server side.

2. **Local disk (fallback)** -- When Cloudinary is not configured, files are stored in the `uploads/` directory and served as static assets via Express at the `/uploads` path.

## Logging

Structured logging is handled by Winston. Logs include timestamps and severity levels. In development, logs are printed to the console. The logger is used throughout the application for request tracking, error reporting, and operational events.
